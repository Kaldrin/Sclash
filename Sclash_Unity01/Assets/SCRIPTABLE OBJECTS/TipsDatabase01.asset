  - If you use a controller, you can use the right stick to dash faster, play as you
    prefer !
  - When your character is slightly transparent it means the adversary can't touch
    you during these frames !
  - You can cancel the charging of an attack with any other move !
  - You can change the number of rounds needed to win the game in the options !
  - The pommel move doesn't cost any stamina !
  - If your guard successfully blocks a hit you immediatly regain 1 stamina bar !
  - You can cancel a parry or a kick with a dash !
  - You can connect the dash with any move !
  - A successful pommel removes 1 stamina bar to your opponent if they are attacking
    or parrying, but watch out you must be very close to them to hit !
