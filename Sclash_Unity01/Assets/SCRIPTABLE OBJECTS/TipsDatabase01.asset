  - If you're using a controller, you can use the right stick or the triggers to dash
    faster, play as you prefer!
  - When your character is slightly transparent, it means the adversary can't touch
    you during these frames, use it to dodge the hits!
  - You can cancel the charging of an attack with any other move.
  - You can change the number of rounds needed to win the game in the options (The
    default number is 5).
  - The pommel move doesn't cost any stamina and interrupts any action your opponent
    might be doing by pushing them, given you're close enough to touch them.
  - If your guard successfully blocks a hit, you immediatly regain 1 stamina bar.
  - You can cancel a pommel with a dash.
  - You can connect the dash with any move.
  - "A successful pommel removes 1 stamina bar to your opponent if they are attacking
    or parrying, but watch out: you must be very close to them in order to hit!\r"
  - You can dash by double tapping the directional input.
  - "When you see a new tip, read it carefully! Tips may help you discover mechanics
    and elements you forgot, or didn't know about!\r"
  - You can cancel a dash with an attack.
  - Your stamina refills faster over time when you stand still, and even faster when
    you walk away from your opponent.
  - Not satisfied by the sound mixing? We have a solution, just check the settings
    to change the different volumes!
  - You can make your own selection of stages to use when loading a random stage,
    just choose the ones you like in the stage selection screen!
